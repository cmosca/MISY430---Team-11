Repo for App team project (Collaber).  Collaber is an iphone application that allows users to easily collaborate for schoolwork purposes.  Users will be able to choose their specific university and the courses they are enrolled in to view/post/comment on topic threads.  Collaber will be used as another resource for students to use when studying for exams, completing assignments, or just gaining insight into the course.
